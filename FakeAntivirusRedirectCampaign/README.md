# üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Wireshark Traffic Analysis ‚Äì Multi-Stage Fake Antivirus Redirect Campaign

This project investigates a real-world browser-based redirect attack captured in a PCAP file. The attack involves a compromised website injecting malicious JavaScript, which initiates chained redirects to attacker-controlled `.tk` domains, ultimately landing the user on a fake antivirus tech support scam page.
