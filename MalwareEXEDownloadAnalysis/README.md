# Wireshark Traffic Analysis – Malware EXE Download via HTTP (2018-11-13)

This project analyzes network traffic capturing the download of a trojanized Windows executable via HTTP. The investigation identifies the infected host, the downloaded file, and subsequent network behavior following the download.

---

## Project Overview

**Goal:**  
Investigate a PCAP to identify malware download activity, extract Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), and document the attack timeline.

**Data:**  
PCAP file from [malware-traffic-analysis.net (2018-11-13)](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2018/11/13/index.html)

**Tools:**  
- Wireshark for packet capture analysis  
- Markdown for documentation

## Tools & Features Used

- HTTP stream filtering and analysis  
- TCP conversation inspection  
- File extraction and hash verification  
- IOC identification and documentation  
- Step-by-step reporting in Markdown

## Analysis Summary

1. Windows client `192.168.2.147` identified by MAC address and hostname `LYAKH-WIN7-PC`  
2. Kerberos traffic reveals user account `jermija.lyakh`  
3. HTTP GET request for Windows executable `vez.exe` from `micropcsystem[.]com` (IP: `198.54.126.123`) at `2018-11-13 02:02:13 UTC`  
4. HTTP 200 OK response delivers the executable file (699,392 bytes)  
5. Extracted file SHA256:  
   `43092b2993c9d9cfab01aa340bc378cad547ae0938c6803cb580271139798765`  
   — confirmed trojan by VirusTotal  
6. Post-download TCP connection attempt from infected host to IP `93.87.38.24`, indicating potential C2 activity
